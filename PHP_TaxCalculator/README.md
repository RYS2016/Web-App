Write a single PHP script, income_tax_v1.php, with the following functionality:

The script will first prompt the user to enter a gross annual income. Upon receiving any valid numeric (integer or float/double) 
value from the form, the script will then calculate the corresponding income tax based on the following tables:

After the user enters the income, say 150000, the view of the application is as shown below. The input form along with the results should be 
displayed.

Hard-code the table values in the conditional statements and the income tax calculations, i.e., donâ€™t define constants to use in the functions. 
The form data is submitted using the POST method.
Write a single PHP script, income_tax_v2.php, with the following functionality:

Define the TAX_RATES using PHP7 array syntax 

This function should not hard code any of the tax table information.

For example, for a taxable income of 50000, the above index value would be 2 for Single, 1 for Married_Jointly, 
\2 for Married_Separately, and 1 for Head_Household.
 
The script should also display the tax tables using the above TAX_RATES data.
